# Find-palindromic-prime-numbers
 This project is a Python script that finds and prints palindromic prime numbers within a specified range.

## Special Number Finder Program

Create a Python program that helps you find **special numbers**! You'll input two positive numbers, `m` and `n` (where `m` is smaller than `n`), and the program should tell you how many special numbers are between them (inclusively). The program should not only count these special numbers but also show them to you.

### Program Requirements:
- If there are fewer than **6 special numbers**, it should display all of them. 
- If there are **6 or more special numbers**, it should show you:
  - The first three **smallest special numbers**.
  - The last three **biggest special numbers**.

### Special Numbers Definition:
Special numbers are numbers that are both:
1. **Prime**: A number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
2. **Palindromic**: A number that reads the same backwards as it does forwards.

### Constraints:
- The program **must not** use a hard-coded list of values (at most, you can have 5 hard-coded values).
- It should **not use external data files** to assist in computation.
- The program should **finish within 1 hour** of run-time for any test case.
- You are encouraged to use Python's **built-in libraries**.
- The solution should be concise, **not exceeding 100 lines** of code.

Each solution should be your own work.
